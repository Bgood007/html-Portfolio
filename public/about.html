<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Brian Goodlett, as the CEO and founder of NION (Network is Our Net Worth), a dynamic commercial financial company, I am deeply invested in both the strategic direction of the business and in personal growth through technology. While leading the company in its mission to revolutionize financial solutions, I am also learning how to build websites and code using Python. This dual focus allows me to blend my leadership skills with a hands-on understanding of the tech that drives modern businesses. By expanding my technical expertise, I aim to enhance NION's digital presence and integrate innovative technologies into our financial services, ultimately strengthening the company’s competitive edge in the market.</p>

<p>As a leader, I believe that true progress comes from creating spaces where everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive. At NION, we strive not only for financial success but also for social responsibility, actively promoting a culture of equality, diversity, and inclusion. I’m committed to using our platform and influence to advocate for positive change—whether it’s through empowering underserved communities, fostering inclusive practices in the workplace, or supporting initiatives that bridge gaps in financial access. Change doesn’t happen overnight, but by leading with empathy and vision, I hope to inspire others to challenge outdated systems, embrace diversity, and work together for a more just and equitable world. At the core of this mission is the belief that when we lift each other up, we all rise—leading to a stronger, more compassionate future for everyone.</p>

<p>I am a proud graduate of Coastal Carolina University, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree and laid the foundation for my professional journey. After graduating class of 2007, it was a rough start to a future with the housing market crash and no jobs available. I found myself at a Kelloggs manufacuting facility for 5 years as a supervisor and then I spent the next decade in the automotive manufacturing industry, working my way up to a managerial role. During those 10 years, I gained invaluable experience in leadership, operations, and problem-solving, managing teams, streamlining processes, and driving efficiency within a high-paced, results-driven environment. However, over time, I realized that my true passion lay in understanding the broader financial landscape and how it could transform businesses and communities. That’s when I decided to pivot. I knew that now was the right time to make the leap into the financial field—an area that not only aligns with my strengths in strategic thinking but also fuels my desire to have a more direct impact on people's financial well-being. It’s been an exciting and challenging transition, and I’m thrilled to bring my unique perspective from manufacturing and operations into the world of finance, with the goal of driving innovation, empowerment, and positive change within the industry.</p>
<p>Let's progress and continue to educate our youth. We are all one.</p>
